A Parking Management System is designed to manage and solve the parking problems of a 
company or institute. The aim of implementing such a system is to reduce time and increase 
efficiency of the current parking management process. In overpopulated cosmopolitan zones, 
parking strategies must be well-implemented for management of vehicles. The system can 
manage the records of incoming and outgoing vehicles in a parking house, making it easy for 
the admin to retrieve data
